## My process
  First I've make the HTML structure and the entire code. After I focused on the css. Nothing really hardðŸ˜‚

### Built with

- HTML Structure
- CSS Variable ( with :root )
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### Continued development

::before and ::after notion ðŸ˜… it's really complicated to a rookie to understand, it must be in
```css
.element{
  display: block;
  content: '';
} 
```
And maybe revise position "absolute" and "relative"
